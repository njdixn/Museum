				<h3>Professor Juniper “June” Calloway</h3>
				<p><strong>Title:</strong> Paleoethnobotanist & Sensory Historian</p>
				<p><strong>Specialty:</strong> A researcher specializing in ancient plant use and the sensory experience of the past</p>
				<p><strong> Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Paleoethnobotanist & Sensory Historian. A researcher specializing in ancient plant use and the sensory experience of the past June combines paleoethnobotany — the study of ancient plant-human relationships — with experimental archaeology and sensory reconstruction. She recreates past environments by identifying seeds, pollen, and plant remains, then hypothesizes how people would have tasted, touched, and smelled their world.</p>

				<p><strong>Professional Bio:</strong> Prof. Calloway holds an MA in Ethnobotany from the University of British Columbia, and a PhD in Archaeobotany from Uppsala University, where she studied under Dr. Liv Söderlund, a sensory history pioneer. Her early work focused on Neolithic cooking pits, and she later branched into perfumery and medicinal salves used in early Mesopotamian cultures. June is highly skilled at identifying ancient plant remains, reconstructing foodways, and working with tactile displays. Her tools range from microscopes to handmade clay ovens, and she often builds small “aroma gardens” for museum visitors. Her personal style is intuitive, nurturing, and sometimes quirky. She tends to follow instinct, but her data is always solid. Visitors often describe her as “a kitchen witch of the past.”</p>

				<p><strong>Museum Role:</strong> June is curating an exhibit titled “The Scents of Civilization,” where visitors can smell reconstructed fragrances, try ancient teas, and even plant heritage seeds in a hands-on workshop. She also oversees preservation techniques for organic materials in the collection.</p>

				<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Won the Alexander Award for Public Engagement in Archaeology for her traveling “Scent Cart” exhibit.She has auditory hypersensitivity, making fieldwork noisy - but also enhances her ability to tune into subtle environmental cues.	Identifies as neurodivergent, often describing her mind as “a forest trail — not always direct, but always rich.”	</p>

				<p><strong>Deeper Persona Questions:</strong>	What’s a relic or discovery that changed their life? A charred lump of barley from an Anatolian hearth. Most saw it as debris. She smelled it, tasted it carefully, and said, “It’s bread. Flat. Burned. But it fed someone.” 	How do they feel about interpreting the meaning of what they find? She believes that interpretation must include human emotion — not just data. “If we forget the senses, we forget the people.” What do they believe about truth in history? June believes history has flavors, and truth is something we feel as much as prove. “Scientific truth is necessary. But emotional truth — that’s what brings the past back to life.”</p>

				<h3>Professor Tarek Onu</h3>
				<p><strong>Title:</strong> Geo-Historical Analyst</p>
				<p><strong>Specialty:</strong>A hybrid expert in physical anthropology and satellite terrain modeling.</p>
				<p><strong> Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Tarek is a specialist in analyzing human remains through the lens of geography, using satellite data and terrain modeling to interpret how landscapes influenced ancient societies. His unique hybrid approach merges physical anthropology with remote sensing technologies.</p>

				<p><strong>Professional Bio:</strong> Dr. Tarek El-Aziz received his PhD in Physical Anthropology from the University of Tübingen and later trained in geospatial analysis at the European Space Agency’s Earth Observation Program. He studied under Dr. Leyla Nassar, a pioneer in bioarchaeological climatology. Tarek specializes in correlating skeletal morphology with environmental pressures, using tools like LIDAR, 3D terrain rendering, and forensic osteometry. He is often seen toggling between a field notebook and a tablet showing layered topographic maps. His style is a mix of meticulous precision and skeptical inquiry. He double-checks everything, but once the data speaks, he’s quick to pursue bold, interdisciplinary hypotheses.</p>

				<p><strong>Museum Role:</strong> At the museum, Tarek is leading a new exhibit called “Bones of the Landscape”, which uses immersive maps and skeletal reconstructions to tell the story of how geography shaped human survival. He’s also mentoring young researchers in digital stratigraphy and collaborating with drone pilots to map ancient caravan routes.</p>

				<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Received the UNESCO Cultural Landscapes Grant for his work reconstructing settlement patterns along the ancient Nile tributaries.	Grew up bilingual in Arabic and French and brings a deep cultural empathy to his fieldwork across North Africa and the Levant. Lives with a form of color vision deficiency — he relies heavily on high-contrast and shape-based data visualizations, which has led him to innovate new display methods used by others with similar needs.</p>

				<p><strong>Deeper Persona Questions:</strong> What’s a relic or discovery that changed their life? In the Sudanese desert, Tarek once discovered a burial site aligned with now-vanished riverbeds. The bones showed signs of both drought and adaptation. It shifted his belief about how resilient ancient humans were to climate extremes. How do they feel about interpreting the meaning of what they find? Tarek believes interpretation is a responsibility, not just a guess. He thinks data must be respected — but so must the cultural voices that echo through it. He always says, “Context before conclusion.” What do they believe about truth in history? Tarek believes that truth in history is layered — like sediment. “No single layer tells the whole story. But put them together, and the landscape speaks.”</p>

				<h3>Dr. Calypso Miren Elouan</h3>
				<p><strong>Title:</strong> Symbolic Analyst & Ritual Semiotician</p>
				<p><strong> Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> A specialist in decoding layered cultural meanings, focusing on symbols, mythic structures, and the semiotics of ritual.</p>

				<p><strong>Professional Bio:</strong>	Dr. Calypso Miren Elouan received their Ph.D. in Comparative Symbol Systems from the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, where they studied under renowned semiotician Amara Vélez. They approach ancient artifacts not as static objects, but as ritual moments frozen in time. Their interpretive lens blends post-structuralist theory, indigenous storywork, and feminist mythography. They have collaborated with the Museum of Human Transcendence and led interpretive salons that reimagine exhibit spaces as dream archives. Dr. Elouan gravitates toward objects with uncertain provenance—things whose stories have been censored, fragmented, or erased. They are often seen as a provocateur, inviting audiences to experience ambiguity, contradiction, and wonder.</p>

				<p><strong>Interpretive Method:</strong> Dr. Elouan turns evidence into insight by: Mapping symbolic patterns across time and geography Hosting myth comparison circles that include elders, activists, and artists Using machine learning to analyze how ritual language evolves Collaborating with performance artists to re-enact ancient ceremonies in interpretive spaces Advocating for co-authored labels, blending scholarly and cultural descendant perspectives</p>

				<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Of Queer Polynesian heritage, Dr. Elouan challenges binary, Western chronologies and pushes for spiralic, story-based timelines in exhibits. They are a vocal proponent of decolonial museology and narrative sovereignty, often clashing with Agent A researchers who seek clear-cut historical "truths". They once returned a sacred drum to its community of origin despite institutional resistance—a moment they call "the most ethical interpretation I've ever made."</p>
				
				<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> A moment they changed their mind: While studying a carved fertility idol in Sardinia, they initially dismissed its "folk" use as ahistorical. But after hearing oral stories from modern midwives, they rewrote their entire framework to include lived ritual and generational memory as valid forms of data. 	Do they feel the weight of speaking for the dead? Yes. They keep a braided strand of red thread on their wrist to remind them: “This is not my story. I’m only part of its echo.” How do they resolve conflicting meanings? By layering them—not erasing. “Meaning isn't a puzzle with one answer,” they often say. “It's a mosaic of perspectives, some chipped, some vivid.”</p>
